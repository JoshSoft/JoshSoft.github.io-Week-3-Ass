        <p class= > Sensorimotor control in three-dimensional environments remains a major challenge in machine
          learning and robotics. The development of autonomous ground vehicles is a long-studied instantiation
          of this problem [22, 26]. Its most difficult form is navigation in densely populated urban
          environments [21]. This setting is particularly challenging due to complex multi-agent dynamics at
          traffic intersections; the necessity to track and respond to the motion of tens or hundreds of other
          actors that may be in view at any given time; prescriptive traffic rules that necessitate recognizing
          street signs, street lights, and road markings and distinguishing between multiple types of other vehicles;
          the long tail of rare events â€“ road construction, a child running onto the road, an accident
          ahead, a rogue driver barreling on the wrong side; and the necessity to rapidly reconcile conflicting
          objectives, such as applying appropriate deceleration when an absent-minded pedestrian strays onto
          the road ahead but another car is rapidly approaching from behind and may rear-end if one brakes
          too hard.
          Research in autonomous urban driving is hindered by infrastructure costs and the logistical difficulties
          of training and testing systems in the physical world. Instrumenting and operating even one
          robotic car requires significant funds and manpower. And a single vehicle is far from sufficient for
          collecting the requisite data that cover the multitude of corner cases that must be processed for both
          training and validation. This is true for classic modular pipelines [21, 8] and even more so for datahungry
          deep learning techniques. Training and validation of sensorimotor control models for urban
          driving in the physical world is beyond the reach of most research groups.
